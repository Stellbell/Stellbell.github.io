<p/><strong> The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis we first pull data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a data set on over 500 cities. <strong>
    <br/><br>
                  After assembling the data set, we used Mathplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. 
                  This site provides the source data and visualisations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
